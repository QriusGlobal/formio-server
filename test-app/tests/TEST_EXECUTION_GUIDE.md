## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npm run playwright:install

      - name: Run unit tests with coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./test-results/coverage/lcov.info

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: |
            test-results/
            playwright-report/
```

### Pre-commit Hook

Add to `.husky/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e:chromium
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Tests failing with "File not found"

```bash
# Ensure test fixtures exist
ls -la tests/fixtures/
```

#### 2. E2E tests timeout

```bash
# Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
timeout: 120000 // 2 minutes
```

#### 3. Coverage below threshold

```bash
# Check specific file coverage
npx vitest tests/unit/TusDemo.test.tsx --coverage
```

#### 4. Playwright browser not installed

```bash
npm run playwright:install
```

#### 5. Port already in use

```bash
# Kill process on port 64849
lsof -ti:64849 | xargs kill -9

# Or change port in package.json
"dev": "vite --port 64850"
```

### Debug Mode

#### Vitest

```bash
# Debug specific test
npx vitest --inspect-brk tests/unit/TusDemo.test.tsx

# Open in VS Code and attach debugger
```

#### Playwright

```bash
# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Headed mode
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Step through
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Verbose Output

```bash
# Vitest verbose
npx vitest --reporter=verbose

# Playwright trace
npx playwright test --trace on
```
