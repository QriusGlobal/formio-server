# E2E Testing Bugs and Edge Cases Report

## ðŸ”´ Critical Bugs Found

### 1. Module Build Issues
- **Bug**: @formio/file-upload module not built (missing `lib/` directory)
- **Impact**: Module cannot be imported in test-app
- **Fix**: Run `npm install && npm run build` in module directory
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Missing Component Exports
- **Bug**: TusFileUpload and UppyFileUpload components missing index.ts exports
- **Impact**: Components cannot be imported correctly
- **Fix**: Create index.ts files in component directories
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Port Conflict
- **Bug**: TUS server trying to use port 1080 which is already in use
- **Impact**: Tests fail when trying to upload to TUS server
- **Fix**: Change test TUS server to port 1081 or stop existing service
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. Shell Command Issues
- **Bug**: `cd` commands failing with `__zoxide_z` error
- **Impact**: Scripts cannot change directories properly
- **Fix**: Use subshells `(cd path && command)` or absolute paths
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

## ðŸŸ¡ Edge Cases Not Covered

### 1. File Size Edge Cases
- Files exactly at size limit (e.g., exactly 10MB)
- Files 1 byte over limit
- Zero-byte files
- Files larger than available RAM (streaming)

### 2. Network Scenarios
- Upload during network speed fluctuation
- Upload during DNS failure
- Upload with proxy/firewall interference
- IPv6 vs IPv4 handling

### 3. Concurrent Operations
- Same file uploaded twice simultaneously
- Deleting file while uploading
- Editing form while upload in progress
- Browser refresh during chunked upload

### 4. File Type Edge Cases
- Files with no extension
- Files with multiple extensions (.tar.gz)
- Files with misleading extensions (PDF named .txt)
- Symbolic links and shortcuts

### 5. Browser-Specific Issues
- Safari private browsing mode
- Firefox strict tracking protection
- Chrome incognito mode storage limits
- Mobile browser background app suspension

### 6. Authentication Edge Cases
- Token expiry during upload
- Token refresh mid-upload
- Multiple tab sessions with different auth
- CORS issues with credentials

### 7. Storage Edge Cases
- Disk space exhaustion during upload
- Quota limits on cloud storage
- Temporary file cleanup failure
- File name conflicts (same name uploaded)

## ðŸŸ¢ Test Coverage Gaps

### 1. Performance Testing
- Upload speed benchmarking
- Memory usage during large uploads
- CPU usage during encryption
- Parallel upload optimization

### 2. Security Testing
- XSS in file names
- Path traversal attempts
- MIME type spoofing
- Malware upload handling

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- Focus management

### 4. Error Recovery
- Server crash during upload
- Database failure during metadata save
- Storage service outage
- CDN failure

## ðŸ“‹ Bug Fix Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

2. Fix component exports and imports
3. Resolve port conflicts
4. Fix shell command issues

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Day 1)
1. Implement proper error handling
2. Add retry mechanisms
3. Fix authentication flow
4. Handle file validation correctly

### Phase 3: Edge Cases (Day 2-3)
1. Add network resilience tests
2. Implement concurrent upload handling
3. Add browser-specific fixes
4. Handle storage edge cases

### Phase 4: Enhanced Testing (Day 4-5)
1. Add performance benchmarks
2. Implement security tests
3. Add accessibility checks
4. Create stress tests

## ðŸ”§ Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Fix module build
cd packages/formio-file-upload
npm install
npm run build

# Link module
cd ../../test-app
npm link ../packages/formio-file-upload

# Install Playwright
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:e2e:formio -- --headed --project=chromium
npm run test:e2e:tus -- --debug
npm run test:e2e:uppy -- --trace on

# Run with specific timeouts
npm run test:e2e -- --timeout=120000

# Generate detailed report
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=html
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Test Results

After fixes are applied:
- âœ… 95% test pass rate
- âœ… <3s upload time for 10MB files
- âœ… 100% recovery from network interruptions
- âœ… All browsers passing core tests
- âœ… No security vulnerabilities
- âœ… Full accessibility compliance

## ðŸš¨ Monitoring Required

1. Memory leaks during long upload sessions
2. File handle exhaustion
3. Zombie processes from failed uploads
4. Storage cleanup job failures
5. Rate limiting issues under load
