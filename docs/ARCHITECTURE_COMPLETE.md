    ├── useTusUpload.ts             # React hooks
    └── FilePreview.tsx             # Preview component
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/form/:formId/submission/:id/upload` | Initialize upload |
| PATCH | `/upload/:uploadId` | Upload chunk |
| HEAD | `/upload/:uploadId` | Check status |
| DELETE | `/upload/:uploadId` | Cancel upload |
| GET | `/file/:fileId` | Download file |
| GET | `/file/:fileId/metadata` | Get metadata |

### Database Schema

**Collections:**
- `files` - Completed file metadata
- `uploadSessions` - Active upload sessions
- `submissions` - Form submissions with file references

**Key Features:**
- TTL indexes for automatic cleanup
- Compound indexes for performance
- File metadata with security info
- Upload session resumability

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication:** JWT tokens in Authorization header
2. **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **File Validation:**
   - Client-side: Size and type checks
   - Server-side: MIME type verification
   - Post-upload: Virus scanning (optional)
4. **Encryption:**
   - Transport: HTTPS/TLS
   - Database: MongoDB encryption at rest
   - Storage: GCS server-side encryption
   - Downloads: Signed URLs with expiration

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

1. **Chunked Uploads:**
   - Default 5MB chunks
   - Dynamic chunk sizing based on network speed
   - Parallel chunk uploads (up to 3)
   - Exponential backoff retry strategy

2. **Caching:**
   - Metadata: Redis, 1 hour TTL
   - Sessions: Redis, 1 hour TTL
   - Downloads: CDN, 24 hours TTL

3. **Targets:**
   - Upload initialization: < 200ms
   - Chunk upload: < 500ms per 5MB
   - Download initialization: < 100ms
   - Metadata fetch: < 50ms
   - Concurrent uploads: 100+ per instance

## 🚀 Deployment Phases

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** | ✅ Complete | Local infrastructure (Docker, GCS emulator, MongoDB) |
| **Phase 1** | 📋 Ready | Component development (architecture complete) |
| **Phase 2** | 🔜 Planned | Testing & validation |
| **Phase 3** | 🔜 Planned | Staging deployment |
| **Phase 4** | 🔜 Planned | Production release |

## 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 1 Implementation

### Backend Development (formio/)

1. Create directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p formio/src/upload
   ```

2. Implement components:
   - [ ] `TusUploadHandler.ts` - tus protocol implementation
   - [ ] `GCSStorageProvider.ts` - GCS integration
   - [ ] `FileMetadataManager.ts` - Database operations
   - [ ] `SubmissionIntegration.ts` - Form linking

3. Add API routes:
   - [ ] Register upload endpoints in Express router
   - [ ] Add authentication middleware
   - [ ] Add authorization checks

### Core Library Development (formio-core/)

1. Create directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p formio-core/src/experimental/components/fileupload
   ```

2. Implement components:
   - [ ] `FileUpload.ts` - Component definition
   - [ ] `FileUploadTypes.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
   - [ ] Register component in component index

### React Library Development (formio-react/)

1. Create directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p formio-react/src/components/TusFileUpload
   ```

2. Implement components:
   - [ ] `TusFileUpload.tsx` - React wrapper
   - [ ] `useTusUpload.ts` - React hooks
   - [ ] `FilePreview.tsx` - Preview component

3. Add dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd formio-react
   npm install @uppy/core @uppy/tus @uppy/react @uppy/dashboard
   ```

### Test App Updates

1. Update test app to use TusFileUpload component
2. Add file upload form
3. Test all upload scenarios
