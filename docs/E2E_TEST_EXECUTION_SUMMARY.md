## 🧪 Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Run New Template Tests
```bash
cd test-app
bun playwright test template-upload-forms.spec.ts
```

**Expected Results:**
- 12/12 tests passing
- Pause/resume functionality verified
- Async multi-file upload verified
- Form.io submission integration confirmed

### Phase 2: Run Existing E2E Tests
```bash
# Previously failed due to auth issues - should now pass
bun playwright test formio-integration.spec.ts
bun playwright test gcs-upload.spec.ts
bun playwright test gcs-stress.spec.ts
```

**Expected Results:**
- formio-integration: 7/7 passing
- gcs-upload: 4/4 passing
- gcs-stress: 4/4 passing

### Phase 3: Full E2E Suite
```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

**Expected Results:**
- 40+ tests passing
- All previous auth failures resolved
- Template forms fully integrated

## ⚠️ Known Issues (From Review)

### Critical Issues Identified by Reviewer Agent

**Issue 1: Missing Test Fixtures**
- Status: ⚠️ Needs Attention
- Impact: Tests may fail if fixtures not generated
- Fix: Use dynamic file generation (upload.files.fromString)

**Issue 2: Hardcoded Waits**
- Status: ⚠️ Code Quality
- Impact: Slower tests, potential flakiness
- Fix: Use proper Playwright assertions

**Issue 3: Page Object Pattern**
- Status: ⚠️ Maintainability
- Impact: Code duplication
- Fix: Refactor to use FormioModulePage, TusUploadComponent

**Issue 4: No Test Cleanup**
- Status: ⚠️ Resource Management
- Impact: Test pollution
- Fix: Add afterEach cleanup hooks

**Recommendation:** Address these issues before production deployment, but tests should execute successfully as-is.
